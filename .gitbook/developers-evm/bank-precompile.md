# Bank Precompile

The Bank Precompile is a system smart contract residing at the fixed address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`.

It offers EVM developers a gas-efficient and native pathway to interact directly with the Biya Chain's **bank module** (`x/bank`). This effectively bringing ERC-20 tokens on-chain. Any ERC-20 contract using the Bank precompile will be represented as `erc20:0x...` denom on-chain. Technically, this means that tokens reside only on-chain, with the EVM providing a view to the chain state rather than maintaining a separate copy. Unlike traditional bridging, where two token versions require user actions to switch, the Bank precompile offers real-time, dual-environment reflection for any transfer using either the on-chain bank denom or the ERC-20 `transfer()` method.

A range of ERC-20 implementations backed by the Bank precompile, alongside precompile interfaces and abstract contracts, are available at [Biya Chain’s Solidity Contracts Repository](https://github.com/biya-coin/solidity-contracts). Key contracts include:

* **Bank.sol** – precompile interface
* **BankERC20.sol** – abstract ERC20 implementation backed by the Bank precompile
* **FixedSupplyBankERC20.sol** – decentralized ERC20 with fixed supply (no owner, no minting or burning)
* **MintBurnBankERC20.sol** – ERC20 with an owner authorized to mint and burn tokens

These implementations are based on OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 contracts. Developers can freely create custom ERC20 contracts utilizing the Bank precompile.

## ERC20 Contract Deployment

**ℹ️ Note:**

To prevent denom spam, deploying an ERC20 contract via the ERC20 module is a **payable operation** and requires a deployment fee of **1 BIYA**. Make sure your ERC20 contract deployment transaction includes this amount, or the operation will be rejected.

## Bank Precompile Interface

<pre class="language-solidity" data-full-width="false"><code class="lang-solidity"><strong>interface IBankModule {
</strong>    function mint(address,uint256) external payable returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address,address) external view returns (uint256);
    function burn(address,uint256) external payable returns (bool);
    function transfer(address,address,uint256) external payable returns (bool);
    function totalSupply(address) external view returns (uint256);
    function metadata(address) external view returns (string memory,string memory,uint8);
    function setMetadata(string memory,string memory,uint8) external payable returns (bool);
}
</code></pre>

## Example

[Wrapped BIYA (wBIYA)](./wrapped-biya.md#is-wbiya-the-same-as-weth "Is wBIYA the same as wETH?") 
makes use of the Bank EVM precompile in order to implement the
[MultiVM Token Standard (MTS)](./multivm-token-standard.md).

## Start building

We've prepared a handful of demos that show how to build contracts using the Bank, Exchange, and Staking precompiles. These examples also demonstrate how to interact with the Biya Chain EVM using the most common Ethereum development framework—**Foundry**.

See the bank precompile demo [here](https://github.com/biya-coin/solidity-contracts/tree/master/demos/erc20) and follow the corresponding README.
