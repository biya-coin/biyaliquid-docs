# Getting Started

Biyachain Trader comes built in with a "Simple Strategy" to aid with rapid prototyping and familiarizing yourself with the codebase.

**What it does:**

* Monitors orderbooks for BIYA, BTC, ETH
* Places buy orders slightly below market price
* Places sell orders slightly above market price
* Maintains a spread for profitability
* Respects position limits for risk control

**Best for:** predictable and steady trading while familiarizing yourself with Biyachain Trader. **Not recommended for production use.**

**Example Logs:**

```
[INFO] Placing BUY order: 0.1 BIYA at $3.45 (spread: 0.5%)
[INFO] Placing SELL order: 0.1 BIYA at $3.47 (spread: 0.5%)
[INFO] Order filled: BUY 0.1 BIYA at $3.45
```

## Customizing Your Strategy

### Order size

```yaml
OrderSize: 0.5
MaxPosition: 2.0
```

### More markets

```yaml
MarketTickers:
  - BIYA/USDT PERP
  - BTC/USDT PERP
  - ETH/USDT PERP
  - APT/USDT PERP
  - AVAX/USDT PERP
  - SOL/USDT PERP
```

### Spreads

```yaml
SpreadThreshold: 0.01   # conservative
SpreadThreshold: 0.002  # aggressive
```

## Common Configurations

### Conservative Maker

```yaml
OrderSize: 0.05
MaxPosition: 0.5
SpreadThreshold: 0.01
```

### Aggressive Maker

```yaml
OrderSize: 0.5
MaxPosition: 5.0
SpreadThreshold: 0.002
```

### Multi-Market Strategy

```yaml
MarketTickers:
  - BIYA/USDT PERP
  - BTC/USDT PERP
  - ETH/USDT PERP
  - APT/USDT PERP
  - AVAX/USDT PERP
  - SOL/USDT PERP
  - TON/USDT PERP
  - ATOM/USDT PERP
```

## Monitoring Your Bot

```bash
tail -f logs/my_bot.log
grep "Order filled" logs/my_bot.log
grep "ERROR" logs/my_bot.log
```

### Key Messages

* ✅ Order placed successfully
* 💰 Order filled
* ⚠️ Position limit reached
* ❌ Insufficient balance

### Performance Metrics

* Total PnL
* Win rate
* Fill rate
* Average spread

## Risk Management

* Set position limits (`MaxPosition`)
* Monitor positions and stop out manually if needed
* Maintain enough USDT for margin, fees, and buffer

## Troubleshooting

**No private keys found**

```bash
echo $MyBot_GRANTER_biyachain_PRIVATE_KEY
```

* **Insufficient balance** → Add USDT / reduce `OrderSize`
* **Market not found** → Double-check tickers/IDs
* **Bot stops working**

```bash
grep "ERROR" logs/my_bot.log | tail -10
python main.py MyBot config.yaml --log_path logs/my_bot.log --network mainnet
```

## Advanced Features

* **Multiple accounts** via `AccountAddresses`
* **Custom order types** (limit, market, reduce-only)
* **External signals** with Redis/Valkey
