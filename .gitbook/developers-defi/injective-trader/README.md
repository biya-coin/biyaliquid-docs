# Biyaliquid Trader

Biyaliquid Trader is a professional-grade framework that provides a high-performance, reliable foundation for developing and deploying algorithmic trading strategies on the Biyaliquid blockchain. It bridges the gap between algorithmic trading strategies and blockchain execution, eliminating technical barriers. The framework takes care of the heavy lifting - real-time data streaming, order execution, reconnection/recovery, transaction batching, and analytics This frees up traders to focus solely on strategy development rather than blockchain complexities.

You can use it to import existing strategies or create new ones that:

* **Place orders automatically** based on your logic
* **Monitor markets 24/7** and react to price changes
* **Manage risk** with built-in limits and safety features
* **Handle multiple markets** simultaneously
* **Provide detailed logs** of all trading activity

### Core Capabilities

Biyaliquid trader transacts assets with real value, as such security is paramount. Be sure to use the following as a security baseline, and also take further measures to protect your assets.

* **Never share private keys** or commit them to Git.
* Store secrets in a local **`.env` file** and load via environment variables.
* For extra safety, consider using [**AuthZ**](https://github.com/biya-coin/biyaliquid-trader/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#authorization-trading-authz) to grant trading rights without exposing your main account.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Get Your Biyaliquid Account Ready (and Funded)

1. **Create an account** on Biyaliquid using Keplr or `biyaliquidd`.
2. If using Keplr, **export your private key** for the `.env` file.
   * _Tip: With AuthZ, you can grant limited permissions to a trading account for better security._
3. **Fund your account** with USDT by sending from another Biyaliquid address, or via [bridge.biyaliquid.network](http://bridge.biyaliquid.network/).
   * _EVM tip: You can derive your `biya` address with the TS SDK and bridge USDT from Ethereum to Biyaliquid without even setting up an Biyaliquid account._

### 2. Download and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biya-coin/biyaliquid-trader.git
cd biyaliquid-trader

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "biyaliquid-py==1.9"
```

_Note: `biyaliquid-trader` is not yet compatible with `biyaliquid-py` v1.11._

### 3. Configure Your Strategy

Edit the preexisting `config.yaml`:

```yaml
Exchange: Helix
ConsoleLevel: INFO
FileLevel: DEBUG

Components:
  Initializer:
    Network: mainnet
    BotName: MyBot
    MarketTickers:
      - BIYA/USDT PERP
      - BTC/USDT PERP
      - ETH/USDT PERP

Strategies:
  MyMarketMaker:
    Name: "MyMarketMaker"
    Class: "SimpleStrategy"
    MarketIds:
      - "0x17ef48032..."  # BIYA/USDT PERP
      - "0x4ca0f92f..."  # BTC/USDT PERP
      - "0x9b998016..."  # ETH/USDT PERP
    AccountAddresses:
      - "biya1your_account_address_here"
    TradingAccount: "biya1your_account_address_here"
    CIDPrefix: "my_mm"
    Parameters:
      OrderSize: 0.1
      MaxPosition: 1.0
      SpreadThreshold: 0.005
```

### 4. Set Your Private Key

Instead of a single `biyaliquid_PRIVATE_KEY`, use **bot-scoped environment variables** in `.env` (matches the framework defaults):

```
# For bot named "MyBot"
MyBot_GRANTER_biyaliquid_PRIVATE_KEY=your_granter_private_key_here
MyBot_GRANTEE_0_biyaliquid_PRIVATE_KEY=your_first_grantee_private_key_here
```

Load them into your session:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

### 5. Run Your Strategy

```bash
python main.py MyBot config.yaml --log_path logs/my_bot.log --network mainnet
```

That's it - your bot is now live!

## IDE set up

If you are using VS code or compatible IDEs (such as Cursor), consider adding the following configuration for easy debugging.

`.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Run MyBot (mainnet)",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "args": ["MyBot", "config.yaml", "--log_path", "logs/strategy.log", "--network", "mainnet"],
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
    },
    {
      "name": "Run MyBot (testnet, debug)",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "args": ["MyBot", "config.yaml", "--log_path", "logs/debug.log", "--network", "testnet", "--debug"],
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
    }
  ]
}
```

You should now be able to do **Run → Start Debugging** in your IDE.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Diagram

### Core Design Patterns

* **Mediator Pattern**: Centralizes communication between components, enabling a decoupled architecture where components interact without direct dependencies.
* **Component Pattern**: Standardizes lifecycle management (initialize, run, terminate) for all system components, ensuring consistent behavior.
* **State Pattern**: Manages component lifecycle through well-defined states (Idle, Running, Terminated), providing predictable transitions and error handling.
* **Task Management Pattern**: Coordinates asynchronous tasks with automated monitoring and recovery, ensuring reliable execution in an event-driven environment.
* **Observer Pattern**: Enables strategies to react to specific update events through specialized event handlers, creating a flexible strategy development approach.

### Key Components

**Exchange-Specific Agents**

* **Initializer**: Sets up exchange connections, accounts, and markets
* **ChainListener**: Streams real-time blockchain data with automatic reconnection
* **MessageBroadcaster**: Handles transaction creation and broadcasting with retry logic
* **Liquidator**: Monitors and executes liquidations for undercollateralized positions

**Managers**

* **MarketManager**: Processes market data and maintains orderbook integrity
* **AccountManager**: Tracks balances, positions, and order state
* **StrategyManager**: Routes market events to appropriate strategy implementations
* **RiskManager**: Enforces position limits and risk controls
* **TaskManager**: Orchestrates and monitors asynchronous task execution

**Data-Level Domains**

* **Market**: Represents trading pairs with orderbooks and metadata
* **Account**: Manages account balances, deposits, and subaccounts
* **Positions**: Tracks derivative positions with P\&L calculations
* **Order**: Order state tracking with execution history
* **Oracle Prices**: Real-time price feeds with timestamp tracking

**Strategy-Level Plugins**

* **Strategy Base**: Template for implementing custom strategies
* **Update Handlers**: Event-specific processors for market data events
* **Performance Metrics**: Statistics and P\&L tracking
* **Risk Models**: Customizable risk management rules
