# Canonical Chain Upgrades

## Verify release versions

### Releases on Github

If you would like to verify `injectived` or `peggo` version numbers via Docker,
follow the instructions in the [`verify-injective-release`](https://github.com/injective-dev/snippets-inj/tree/main/verify-injective-release) code snippet.

This is useful if you are on an operating system other than Linux,
and would like to independently verify the binaries in each release.

For example, for `v1.16.1`, it should produce the following output:

```text
injectived version
Version v1.16.1 (8be67e82d)
Compiled at 20250802-1910 using Go go1.23.9 (amd64)
peggo version
Version v1.16.1 (8be67e82d)
Compiled at 20250802-1913 using Go go1.23.9 (amd64)
```

### Releases on Docker

These are more straightforward, as each binary needs a single command.

For `injectived`, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -it --rm injectivelabs/injective-core:v1.16.1 injectived version
```

This should produce output similar to:

```text
Version v1.16.1 (8be67e8)
Compiled at 20250802-1909 using Go go1.23.9 (arm64)
```

For `peggo`, use the following command:

```shell
docker run -it --rm injectivelabs/injective-core:v1.16.1 peggo version
```

This should produce output similar to:

```text
Version v1.16.1 (8be67e8)
Compiled at 20250802-1911 using Go go1.23.9 (arm64)
```

Note that you should replace `v1.16.1` in the commands above
with your intended Injective release version number.

### Checking for matches

Note that the output from the above commmands contain
the following in addition to the version numbers (e.g. `v1.16.1`):

- The binary release hashes (e.g. `8be67e82d`)
- The compiled time stamp (e.g. `20250802-1910`)
- The compiler (e.g. `Go go1.23.9 (amd64)`)

You can verify that these **match** the values stated in the [Injective chain releases](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-chain-releases/releases) page on Github.
