# MsgBroadcaster Transaction

The `MsgBroadcaster` abstraction class is a way to broadcast transactions on Biyaliquid with ease. With it, you can pass a Message that you want to be packed in a transaction and the signer's address and the transaction will be prepared, signed, and broadcasted.

An example of usage can be found on our [Helix demo repo](https://github.com/biya-coin/biyaliquid-helix-demo). As for the messages that you can pass to the `broadcast` methods, you can find examples in the [Core Modules](../examples/) section of the docs.

## MsgBroadcaster + Wallet Strategy

This MsgBroadcaster is used alongside the Wallet Strategy class for building decentralized applications.

To instantiate (and use) the `MsgBroadcaster` class, you can use the following code snippet

```ts
import { MsgSend } from "@biya-coin/sdk-ts";
import { toChainFormat } from "@biya-coin/utils";
import { MsgBroadcaster } from "@biya-coin/wallet-core";
import { ChainId, EvmChainId } from "@biya-coin/ts-types";
import { WalletStrategy } from "@biya-coin/wallet-strategy";
import { Network, getNetworkEndpoints } from "@biya-coin/networks";

const chainId = ChainId.Testnet; // The Biyaliquid Testnet Chain ID
const evmChainId = EvmChainId.TestnetEvm; // The Biyaliquid Evm Testnet Chain ID

export const alchemyRpcEndpoint = `https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/${process.env.APP_ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_KEY}`;

export const walletStrategy = new WalletStrategy({
  chainId,
  evmOptions: {
    evmChainId,
    rpcUrl: alchemyRpcEndpoint,
  },
});

export const msgBroadcaster = new MsgBroadcaster({
  walletStrategy,
  simulateTx: true,
  network: Network.Testnet,
  endpoints: getNetworkEndpoints(Network.Testnet),
  gasBufferCoefficient: 1.1,
})(
  // Usage Example
  async () => {
    const signer = "biya1...";

    const msg = MsgSend.fromJSON({
      amount: {
        denom: "biya",
        amount: toChainFormat(0.01).toFixed(),
      },
      srcBiyaliquidAddress: signer,
      dstBiyaliquidAddress: "biya1...",
    });

    // Prepare + Sign + Broadcast the transaction using the Wallet Strategy
    await msgBroadcastClient.broadcast({
      biyaliquidAddress: signer,
      msgs: msg,
    });
  }
)();
```

### Constructor/Broadcast Options

We allow to override some of the options passed to the constructor of `MsgBroadcaster` as well as when broadcasting the transaction. Here is the interface and the meaning of each field

````typescript
import { Msgs } from '@biya-coin/sdk-ts'
import { ChainId } from '@biya-coin/ts-types'
import { Network, NetworkEndpoints } from '@biya-coin/networks'
import type { WalletStrategy } from '../strategies'

export interface MsgBroadcasterOptions {
  network: Network /** network configuration (chainId, fees, etc) - Network.MainnetSentry for mainnet or  Network.TestnetSentry for testnet */
  endpoints?: NetworkEndpoints /** optional - overriding the endpoints taken from the `network` param **/
  feePayerPubKey?: string /** optional - if you are using the fee delegation service, you can set the fee payer so you don't do an extra query to the Web3Gateway */
  simulateTx?: boolean /** simulate the transaction before broadcasting + get gas fees needed for the transaction */
  txTimeout?: number /** optional - blocks to wait for tx to be included in a block **/
  walletStrategy: WalletStrategy
  gasBufferCoefficient?: number /** optional - as gas buffer to add to the simulated/hardcoded gas to ensure the transaction is included in a block */
}

export interface MsgBroadcasterTxOptions {
  memo?: string /** MEMO added to the transaction **/
  biyaliquidAddress: string /** the signer of the transaction **/
  msgs: Msgs | Msgs[] /** the messages to pack into a transaction **/

  /*
  *** overriding the hardcoded gas/simulation -
  *** depending on the simulateTx parameter in
  *** the MsgBroadcaster constructor
  */
  gas?: {
    gasPrice?: string
    gas?: number /** gas limit */
    feePayer?: string
    granter?: string
  }
}

```
````

\{% hint style="info" %\} To override the `endpoints` and use your infrastructure (which is something we recommend), please read more on the [Networks](../../developers/concepts/networks.md) page on the endpoints you need to provide and how to set them up. \{% endhint %\}

## MsgBroadcaster with Private Key

This MsgBroadcaster is used with a private key (mostly used for CLI environments). Constructor/broadcast options are quite similar as for the `MsgBroadcaster`.

```ts
import { toChainFormat } from "@biya-coin/utils";
import { MsgSend, MsgBroadcasterWithPk } from "@biya-coin/sdk-ts";

export const msgBroadcasterWithPk = new MsgBroadcasterWithPk({
  privateKey: `0x...` /** private key hash or PrivateKey class from sdk-ts */,
  network: NETWORK,
})(
  // Usage Example
  async () => {
    const signer = "biya1...";

    const msg = MsgSend.fromJSON({
      amount: {
        denom: "biya",
        amount: toChainFormat(0.01).toFixed(),
      },
      srcBiyaliquidAddress: signer,
      dstBiyaliquidAddress: "biya1...",
    });

    // Prepare + Sign + Broadcast the transaction using the Wallet Strategy
    await msgBroadcasterWithPk.broadcast({
      biyaliquidAddress: signer,
      msgs: msg,
    });
  }
)();
```
