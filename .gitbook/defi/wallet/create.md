# Create a wallet

Creating a wallet on Biyaliquid is as simple as sending some funds to your Biyaliquid address. In this document we'll outline how to create a wallet using some popular wallet solutions (Metamask, Ledger, etc.), but also how to create and fund a wallet using `biyaliquidd` in a local CLI environment.

### Browser Wallets

You can create an Biyaliquid wallet using your preferred wallet by following the [tutorial on our blog](https://biyaliquid.com/blog/how-to-create-an-biyaliquid-wallet-2/).

### Local Wallets

You can create an Biyaliquid wallet for your development purposes using [biyaliquidd](../../developers/biyaliquidd/ "mention") in a CLI environment. You can do that using the `biyaliquidd keys` [command](../../developers/biyaliquidd/advanced.md#keys).

You can also learn more about keyring management using `biyaliquidd` on this page [set-up-keyring.md](../../infra/set-up-keyring.md "mention")
