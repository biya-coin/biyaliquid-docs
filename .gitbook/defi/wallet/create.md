# Create a wallet

Creating a wallet on Injective is as simple as sending some funds to your Injective address. In this document we'll outline how to create a wallet using some popular wallet solutions (Metamask, Ledger, etc.), but also how to create and fund a wallet using `injectived` in a local CLI environment.

### Browser Wallets

You can create an Injective wallet using your preferred wallet by following the [tutorial on our blog](https://injective.com/blog/how-to-create-an-injective-wallet-2/).

### Local Wallets

You can create an Injective wallet for your development purposes using [injectived](../../developers/injectived/ "mention") in a CLI environment. You can do that using the `injectived keys` [command](../../developers/injectived/advanced.md#keys).

You can also learn more about keyring management using `injectived` on this page [set-up-keyring.md](../../infra/set-up-keyring.md "mention")
