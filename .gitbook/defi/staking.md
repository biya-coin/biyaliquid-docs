# Staking

### What is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your assets (in this case BIYA) in order to validate transactions on the blockchain. Users who stake their assets are usually eligible for staking rewards.

Biyaliquid follows a proof-of-stake mechanism, in which users can stake their BIYA tokens with certain Biyaliquid nodes that validate transactions (validators). In return, the user can obtain staking rewards in BIYA.

### Stake BIYA

[Stake](https://biyahub.com/stake) your BIYA to a validator to start earning rewards.

### Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake BIYA. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of [Biyaliquid Hub](https://biyahub.com/stake). Once you have earned a sufficient amount of rewards, you may withdraw them at any time.

### Redelegate

Redelegating lets you instantly transfer staked BIYA from one validator to another without undergoing the 21-day unstaking period.

### Undelegate

Undelegating BIYA is the process of unstaking your assets from a validator, which takes 21 days to complete.
