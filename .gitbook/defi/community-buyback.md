# Community BuyBack

### What is the Community BuyBack?

The Community BuyBack is a monthly onchain event that allows anyone to take part in Biya Chain’s deflationary mechanism. Participants commit BIYA, and in return receive a pro rata share of the revenue generated across the Biya Chain ecosystem. The BIYA exchanged is then permanently burned, reducing the total supply.

This process rewards the community, increases scarcity of BIYA, and aligns long-term value with ecosystem success. The Community BuyBack evolved from the original Burn Auction, replacing the winner-take-all model with a simpler, more accessible, and community-driven design.

### Key Details at a Glance

A quick reference box (almost like a cheat sheet) with the most important parameters:

* Cadence: 28 days
* Slots: Fixed number
* Funding Source: Portion of ecosystem-generated revenue
* Commitment: BIYA only, within posted min/max limits
* Distribution: Pro rata, based on BIYA commitment
* Outcome: BIYA burned + assets distributed to participants
* Transparency: Fully onchain

### Why It Matters

* Deflationary Design – Each round burns BIYA, reducing total supply
* Democratized Access – Shared opportunity vs. one auction winner
* Aligned Incentives – Rewards scale with ecosystem activity, rather than network congestion (txn fees stay low regardless)
* Onchain Proof – Everything is transparent and verifiable

### How It Works

1. **Secure Your Spot**\
   Once per month, a fixed number of reservation slots open. Anyone can reserve a slot while they remain available.
2. **Commit BIYA**\
   Reserve your slot by committing BIYA within the displayed minimum and maximum limits. Commitments are made onchain during the event window and cannot be altered once submitted.
3. **Claim Earnings**\
   When the event concludes, all BIYA commitments are exchanged for the revenue collected that month. This revenue, made up of multiple different tokens, is distributed pro rata to all participants.\
   \
   To claim, simply go to Biya Chain Hub → Community BuyBack, and press Claim next to the round you participated in under BuyBack History.
4. **BIYA BuyBack**\
   The total BIYA collected from all participants is permanently burned, reducing the total supply of BIYA.
5. **Get Ready for Next Month**\
   Track your earnings, monitor stats from previous rounds, and stay updated on the next Community BuyBack directly from your Biya Chain Hub dashboard. All slot reservations, commitments, burn transactions, and distributions are publicly visible onchain.

### FAQ

**What determines my share?**\
Your share equals your committed BIYA divided by the total BIYA committed across all participants (pro rata).

**Can I withdraw or change my commitment once made?**\
No, commitments are final once submitted.

**How do I know the burn happened?**\
The burn transaction is onchain and can be tracked via the [Biya Chain Hub](https://biyahub.com/community-buyback).

**What if I miss a round?**\
You’ll need to wait until next month’s event opens.
