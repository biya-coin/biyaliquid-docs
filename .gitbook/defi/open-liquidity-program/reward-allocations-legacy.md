# Legacy Reward Allocations

## Market Reward Allocations

Rewards are allocated to [eligible markets](eligible-markets.md) in two different methods:

1. Static allocations
2. Static allocations with a dynamic component

### Static Market Reward Allocations (Preallocations)

12.5% of BIYA rewards will be preallocated to each of the BTC/USDT PERP market, ETH/USDT PERP market, and BIYA/USDT PERP market. 1% will be preallocated to each remaining eligible market as a minimum allocation:

| Market                 | Total Allocation                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BTC/USDT Perp          | 12.5%                                                                                  |
| ETH/USDT Perp          | 12.5%                                                                                  |
| BIYA/USDT Perp          | 12.5%                                                                                  |
| Other Eligible Markets | 1% each + formula based allocation, with reward cap based on formula (see table below) |

{% hint style="info" %}
Static allocations may change over time as more markets are added to the eligible list
{% endhint %}

### Dynamic Market Reward Allocations

The remaining rewards will be allocated to the eligible markets (excluding BTC/ETH/BIYA Perps) based on the following equation:

$$
Rewards_{Market_i} = TAR * Preallocation_{Market_i} + TAR * (1- Preallocation_{Total}) *\newline \frac {\sum\limits_{MM} (LS_{MM,\  Market_i})^{0.7} * Volume_{MM,\  Market_i}} {\sum\limits_{Market}\sum\limits_{MM} (LS_{MM,\ Market})^{0.7}*Volume_{MM,\ Market}}
$$

$$
\text{where} \quad Preallocation_{Total} = 0.125+0.125+0.125+Other\  Preallocations
$$

$$
\text{and} \quad TAR = Total\ Available\ Rewards
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
$$Other\ Preallocations$$ refers to the static market reward allocations for non-BTC, ETH, and BIYA perp markets.

For more information on $$TAR$$ each epoch, see the [Reward Pool](rewards.md) page.
{% endhint %}

For each eligible market, the product of the MM[^1]’s $$LS^{0.7}$$ and $$Volume$$ is aggregated across all MMs. Rewards are allocated to each market based on the proportional aggregate products across all applicable markets. The preallocation amount (1%) for the market is also added in.

#### Markets Added Partway Through an Epoch

For markets added to the eligible list midway through an epoch, the 1% preallocation will be prorated. For example, if ARB/USDT is added on the 15th day of the epoch, then the market will receive a 0.5% preallocation (there are 14 days left out of 28. If there are 17 days left, then the market will receive $$\frac {17}{28} * 0.01$$).

### Market Allocation Cap

For each market that has dynamic reward allocations, a hard cap will be applied according to the following formula, where $$n$$ is the number of eligible markets excluding BTC, ETH, and BIYA perps:

$$
Rewards_{max} = TAR\ *\ \frac{1 - 0.375}{n}*2
$$

Any reward allocations that exceed the cap will be redistributed amongst the other eligible markets according to the [dynamic allocation formula](reward-allocations-legacy.md#dynamic-market-reward-allocations).

## Market Maker Reward Allocations

Rewards to individual MMs[^2] will be allocated based on the following equation:

$$
Rewards_{MM_i} = \sum_{Market}\left(Rewards_{Market} * \frac {TS_{MM_i, \ Market}} {\sum_{MM} TS_{MM,\ Market}} \right)
$$

**Each** [**MM**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **will receive rewards based on the** [**MM**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]**’s proportional**[ $$TS$$ ](scoring.md#total-score)**within the market, subject to governance approval.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewards for addresses totaling < 1 BIYA at the end of each epoch will be disregarded to reduce the overhead of the disbursement process.
